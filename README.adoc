The `placementd` service acts as a intermediary between the Neutron compute
plane and third party orchestration tools like

== Documentation


=== Development

The full development stack for `placementd` requires Kubernetes, which for
local development purposes can be accomplished with
link:https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind]. Launching the cluster should be done
with: `kind cluster create --config contrib/kind.yml`

Once `kind` is up and running, there are a number of `make` targets defined in
the `Makefile` to help with development, simply running `make` will list the
built-in help for these targets. Generally speaking `make migrations develop`
will ensure that the development database (PostgreSQL running in `kind`) is
configured and deployed.

For simply running tests, `cargo test` can run the unit tests, while `make
check` can run all unit and integration tests.

=== Environment Variables

== Design


=== Database task system

* When a runsubmit API call is is received a new task is created in the database: state = PLANNED
* SubmitWorker does a SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE state = PLANNED FOR UPDATE LIMIT 1
  * submits the Deployment to EKS
  * busy-waits for the Deployment to be "Ready"
  * submits the job via REST to the manager node
  * updates the state to RUNNING
* StatusWorker does a SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE state = RUNNING FOR UPDATE LIMIT 1
* StatusWorker interrogates the REST API on the manager, for its status:
  * if it's still running: then exit
  * if it's finished: set state to COMPLETED
* CleanupWorker does a SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE state = COMPLETED FOR UPDATE LIMIT 1
  * Deletes resources in EKS
  * Once resources are complete, set state to FINALIZED
